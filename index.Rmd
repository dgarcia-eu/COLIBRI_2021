### Our aim is to understand human behavior and socio-technical phenomena in the digital society

---

## *Computational* in Computational Social Science
It can have three meanings:

- **Digital**<br> 
Based on large datasets of human behavior, for example produced by the Web and social media

- **Computerized**<br>
The quantitative analysis of data in an automated, tractable, repeatable, and extensible fashion

- **Generative**<br>
Application of data and results to design of agent-based models that explain complex social phenomena and motivate interventions

---


## Strengths and weaknesses of digital trace data

**Strengths:**
- Complementary approach to traditional survey and experimental methods
- Unprecedented scales and granularities
- Ease of data access, replicability of results
- Potentially high external validity, behavior in vivo

**Weaknesses:**
- Limits to internal validity: Lack of counterfactuals hinders causal analysis
- Self-selection bias: Who talks? Normalization issues: Who is silent?
- Data gatekeepers, Twitter as a model organism
- Intractability of black-box predictions and data piñatas

Problems with macroscopes:
1. Representation issues
2. Performative behavior
3. Measurement error and bias
4. Algorithmic confounding
5. Social media drift
6. Researcher degrees of freedom

- Results improve with gender rescaling: demographic information improves representation in social media data
- Supervised classifier for happiness greatly outperforms dictionary-based
- Similar results in detrended cross-correlation analysis

### Outperforming humans in social media emotion detection?

- **Transfer learning:** good results answering the International Survey on Emotion Antecedents and Reactions (F1 between 0.73 and 0.86)
- **Pilot:** Outperforms Mechanical Turkers (high approval rate, US).  
McNemar test of LEIA vs majority vote ( $\chi^2=74$, p<0.001).
- **Current work:** testing versus native-speaking psychology students



| Emotion | LEIA  | Individual Rater | Majority Vote |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Affection  | **70.5  [64.2, 76.8]** |  41.0 [36.0, 46.2] | 53.5  [46.6, 60.5] |
| Anger | **68.0 [61.3, 74.4]** | 40.0  [34.7, 45.3]  |  34.4 [28.0, 41.1] |
| Fear | **65.5 [58.7, 72.0]** | 33.1 [28.3, 38.0] | 41.5  [34.7, 48.3] |
| Happiness  | **81.1 [75.3, 86.2]** | 63.2  [57.7, 68.5] | 65.5 [58.8, 72.1] |
| Sadness | **65.0 [58.3, 71.5]** | 49.0 [43.7, 54.1] | 47.0  [40.0, 53.9] |
